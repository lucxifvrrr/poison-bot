## How to Apply Changes

1. **Edit `config.py`** with your desired values
2. **Restart the bot** for changes to take effect
3. **Test the changes** with a test mute/unmute

**Note:** Changes to `config.py` require a bot restart. The bot does not hot-reload configuration.

---

## Best Practices

1. **Backup First**: Always backup `config.py` before making changes
2. **Test Changes**: Test in a development server before production
3. **Consistent Theme**: Keep emojis and colors consistent across your server
4. **Accessibility**: Ensure colors have good contrast for readability
5. **Language**: Keep messages clear and professional
6. **Documentation**: Comment your custom changes for future reference

---

## Troubleshooting

### Colors not showing?
- Ensure hex values are in format `0xRRGGBB`
- Check that you're using the `Colors` class correctly

### Emojis not displaying?
- Verify custom emoji IDs are correct
- Ensure the bot has access to custom emojis
- Standard Unicode emojis should work everywhere

### Messages not updating?
- Restart the bot after config changes
- Check for syntax errors in `config.py`
- Verify you're editing the correct file
