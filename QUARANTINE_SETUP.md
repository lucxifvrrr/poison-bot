# Quarantine System Setup Complete ✅

## What Was Done

### 1. **Folder Structure Created**
```
cogs/
└── quarantine/
    ├── __init__.py              # Package initialization
    ├── config.py                # Configuration constants
    ├── quarantine_system.py     # Main mute/quarantine system (moved from cogs/)
    ├── appeal_system.py         # NEW: Modern appeal system
    └── README.md                # Complete documentation
```

### 2. **File Changes**
- ✅ **Moved**: `cogs/quarantine-system.py` → `cogs/quarantine/quarantine_system.py`
- ✅ **Created**: `cogs/quarantine/__init__.py` - Package marker
- ✅ **Created**: `cogs/quarantine/config.py` - Centralized configuration
- ✅ **Created**: `cogs/quarantine/appeal_system.py` - Complete appeal system
- ✅ **Created**: `cogs/quarantine/README.md` - Full documentation

### 3. **No Changes Needed**
- ✅ `main.py` - Already supports subdirectory cog loading
- ✅ `.env` - No new environment variables needed
- ✅ `requirements.txt` - No new dependencies needed

## New Appeal System Features

### **For Users:**
- `/appeal <case_id>` - Submit an appeal using a modern modal interface
- `/appeal-status [appeal_id]` - Check status of your appeals
- Automatic DM notifications when appeals are reviewed
- 24-hour cooldown between submissions
- Clean, intuitive UI with Discord modals

### **For Moderators:**
- `/appeal-list` - View all pending appeals
- `/appeal-review <appeal_id>` - Review specific appeal with interactive buttons
- One-click approve/deny with automatic unmuting
- Appeals appear in punishment-logs channel with review buttons
- Auto-expiration of old appeals (7 days)

## How It Works

### Appeal Workflow:
1. **User is muted** → Gets case ID in DM
2. **User appeals** → `/appeal <case_id>` opens modal
3. **User fills form** → Explains why punishment should be lifted
4. **Moderator notified** → Message appears in punishment-logs with buttons
5. **Moderator reviews** → Clicks ✅ Approve or ❌ Deny
6. **Auto-action** → If approved, user is automatically unmuted
7. **User notified** → Gets DM with result

### Integration:
- Seamlessly works with existing quarantine system
- Uses same MongoDB database and collections
- Shares configuration (mod roles, log channels)
- Automatic case validation and tracking

## Quick Start

### First Time Setup:
```
1. Run: /setup-mute
2. Run: !setmodrole @ModRole
3. Done! Both systems are ready
```

### Usage Examples:

**Mute someone:**
```
!qmute @user 1h spamming
```

**User appeals:**
```
/appeal 1
[Modal opens with form to fill]
```

**Moderator reviews:**
```
/appeal-list
[Shows all pending appeals]

Click buttons on appeal message to approve/deny
```

## Database Collections

### New Collections:
- `appeals` - Appeal records with status tracking
- `appeal_messages` - Links appeals to Discord messages
- `appeal_counters` - Appeal ID generation

### Existing Collections (Used):
- `guild_configs` - Server settings
- `mutes` - Mute records and cases

## Configuration Options

Edit `cogs/quarantine/config.py`:

```python
APPEAL_COOLDOWN_HOURS = 24          # Cooldown between appeals
MAX_APPEAL_LENGTH = 1000            # Max appeal text length
APPEAL_REVIEW_TIMEOUT_DAYS = 7      # Days before auto-expire
```
